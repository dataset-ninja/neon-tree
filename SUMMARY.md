**Data for the NeonTreeEvaluation Benchmark (RGB)** is a dataset for an object detection task. It is used in the ecological research, and in the forestry domain. 

The dataset consists of 2309 images with 30098 labeled objects belonging to 1 single class (*tree*).

Images in the NeonTreeEvaluation: RGB dataset have bounding box annotations. There are 2095 (91% of the total) unlabeled images (i.e. without annotations). There are 2 splits in the dataset: *evaluation* (2289 images) and *training* (20 images). Additionally, the images has ***site_id*** and ***site_name***. The images in *evaluation* split are grouped by ***grid_id***. Also, 175 images are marked with ***unnamed*** tag. The dataset was released in 2022 by the University of Florida.
