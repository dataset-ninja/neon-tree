**Data for the NeonTreeEvaluation Benchmark** is a dataset for object detection tasks. It is used in the ecological research, and forestry domain. 

The dataset consists of 2295 images with 8672 labeled objects belonging to 1 single class (*tree*).

Images in the NeonTreeEvaluation dataset have bounding box annotations. There are 2095 (91% of the total) unlabeled images (i.e. without annotations). There are no pre-defined <i>train/val/test</i> splits in the dataset. The dataset was released in 2022 by the [University of Florida](https://www.ufl.edu/).
