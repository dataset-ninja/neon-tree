**Data for the NeonTreeEvaluation Benchmark** is a dataset for object detection tasks. It is applicable or relevant across various domains.

The dataset consists of 2295 images with 8672 labeled objects belonging to 1 single class (*tree*).

Each image in the NeonTreeEvaluation dataset has bounding boxes annotations. There are 2095 (91% of the total) unlabeled images (i.e. without annotations). There is 1 split in the dataset: *ds* (2295 images). The dataset was released in 2022.

Here is the visualized example grid with annotations:
